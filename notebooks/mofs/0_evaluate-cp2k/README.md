# Determine Proper Settings for CP2K

[Previous](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsnano.2c11102) [papers](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-023-00969-x) have demonstrated the use of CP2K for MOFs.
CP2K is a linear-scaling DFT code, which makes it particularly promising for simulating the large unit cells typical for MOFs
